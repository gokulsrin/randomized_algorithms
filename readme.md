# Randomized Algorithms Coding Assingments 

## Problem 1: Quicksort Analysis:
Please refer to [quicksort](./quicksort.ipynb). This file contains the results of my quicksort implementation and experimentation.

## Problem 2: Seeing Chernoff Bound:
Please refer to [chernoff](./chernoff.ipynb). This file shows some nifty visualizations for the chernoff bound. 

## Problem 3: Estimating Digits of Pi:
Please refer to [pi](./digitspi.ipynb). This file contains my work for the monte-carlo estimations of pi, and using some mean/median tricks. 

## Problem 4: Balls and Bins:
Please refer to [ballsandbins](./ballsandbins.ipynb). There are several visualizations in this notebook that are cool. 

## Problem 5: Count Sketch & Count Min:
Please refer to [CountSketchMin](./CountSketchMin.ipynb). From my experimentation, Count-Min seemed to be far and away the better algorithm space and _surprisingly_ accuracy-wise.  

## Problem 6: Distinct Item Estimation:
Please refer to [EstimatingDistinctItems](./EstimatingDistinctItems.ipynb). I was most impressed by the Flajolet-Martin algorithm. It was absolutley incredible to see, emperically, how good the algorithm is.
